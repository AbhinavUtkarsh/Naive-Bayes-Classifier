# Text Classifier

This repo just has a working implementation of Naive Bayes classification algorithm which could also be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html).

## Data
The data used for training the model has 20 different classes of texts which can be seen in the image bellow:
